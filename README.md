# Scoring Event Detection in Basketball Videos

The ever-growing collection of data combined with the fast advancement in Artificial
Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning have opened endless opportunities in team
sports like basketball, football, and soccer, to name a few.

There is a colossal amount of video data for sports. The first step to employ this data for
performance enhancement and improved decision making, both on a team as well as an
athlete level, might be to develop algorithms that make machines understand the important
events that take place during a sports match.
